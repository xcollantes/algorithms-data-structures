# Sorting algorithms

Stable sort type: Elements with identical values are sorted in the same order.
For example, in an array `[4, 6, 4, 1, 0]`, the sorted form would be `[0, 1, 4,
4, 6]`. A stable algorithm would sort the array with the duplicate values in
the same order where the first 4 in the unsorted array also comes first in the
sorted array.

Usually in sorting, we don't differentiate with duplicate values. But in
practice, the duplicate numbers could represent something (like being tied to
some address).
