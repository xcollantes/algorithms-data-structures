Depth first search.

Known as Depth First Traversal, is the recursive algorithm to visit each node in
a graph or tree structure.

The purpose is to reach as far as the graph can go, hence "depth" as opposed to
Breadth First Search which iterates nodes in a graph nearest to the starting
point first.
