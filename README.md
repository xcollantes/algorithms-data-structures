# Algorithms and Data Structures

Practice code and notes for technical interviews and essential algorithms.

## New iterations

Perfect practice makes perfect.

Fork repo with date to practice. Directories have `README.md` explaining
concepts with notes for each subject.

## Reference

### Data structures

Different ways to store data.

## Interviewing

### Prep

Use this repo to prepare for the Data Structures and Algorithms portion of the
interview.

Read all of [_Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann
McDowell_](https://engbookspdf.xyz/uploads/pdf/Cracking%20The%20Coding%20Interview%206th%20Edition%20by%20Laakmann.pdf)

Along with Data Structures and Algorithms, interviewer may also ask you about:

- Linux system administration commands
- How the internet works
- How a computer works
- How to structure a web server

These topics are not covered here.

### During the interview

1. Get to know who's interviewing you.
1. Listen carefully to the interviewer's question.
1. IMPORTANT: Ask clarifying questions.

   - "What are we optimizing for? Time, space, speed?"

1. Speak your thoughts on how to structure the solution: Think upfront and get
   issues out of the way to avoid completely changing the solution you're coding
   halfway through.

1. Clarify use cases, look for most obvious case, look for edge cases.

1. Think of the most direct solution which could be a brute force solution.

1. Optimize your solution.

1. Ask for feedback.

TIPS: Feel free to ask for help.
