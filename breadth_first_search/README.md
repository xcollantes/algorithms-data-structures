# Breadth First Search

Traverse graph structure by reaching each node. This search algorithm is similar
to DFS except BFS will check the sibling nodes first as opposed to traversing
the entire length of child nodes first.

- BFS prioritizes exploring nodes closer to the starting node, hence the
  "breadth-first" approach.
- It guarantees finding the shortest path between the starting node and any
  reachable node in an unweighted graph.
- BFS is commonly used for tasks like finding connected components in a graph,
  searching for specific nodes, and performing level-order traversals of trees.
