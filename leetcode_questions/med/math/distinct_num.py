"""357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

Medium

Given an integer n, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, x, where
0 <= x < 10n.


Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 91
Explanation: The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 â‰¤ x < 100,
excluding 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99


Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 1


Constraints:
0 <= n <= 8
