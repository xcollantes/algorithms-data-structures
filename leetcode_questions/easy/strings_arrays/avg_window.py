    Prefix sum is a technique that can be used on arrays (of numbers). The idea
    is to create an array prefix where prefix[i] is the sum of all elements up
    to the index i (inclusive). For example, given nums = [5, 2, 1, 6, 3, 8], we
    would have prefix = [5, 7, 8, 14, 17, 25].

    When a subarray starts at index 0, it is considered a "prefix" of the array.
    A prefix sum represents the sum of all prefixes.

    Prefix sums allow us to find the sum of any subarray in ï¿½ ( 1 ) O(1). If we
    want the sum of the subarray from i to j (inclusive), then the answer is
    prefix[j] - prefix[i - 1], or prefix[j] - prefix[i] + nums[i] if you don't
    want to deal with the out of bounds case when i = 0.

    This works because prefix[i - 1] is the sum of all elements before index
    i. When you subtract this from the sum of all elements up to index j, you
    are left with the sum of all elements starting at index i and ending at
    index j, which is exactly what we are looking for.
